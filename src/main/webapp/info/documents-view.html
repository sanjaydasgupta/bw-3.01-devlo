<p>
The documents view page helps you to find the information you need. You can search for files, download them,
and also upload any new versions you create (if applicable).
</p>

<p>
To find a document, first select its category from the dropdown list in the search bar. Then select a subcategory
from the next dropdown list, and click on the <i>Find</i> button. All documents meeting the criteria selected
will be listed in a table below the search bar as in the figure below.
</p>

<p>
The table has columns for each document's name, description, version-comments, timestamp, and author.
It also has a column with download links, and another column with links to RFIs.
RFI links have the form <i>= N =</i>, where the <i>N</i> is the number of existing RFIs.
Clicking on an RFI link opens the view(s) described below. These new views overlay the table with the search
result.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a document with <u>no existing RFIs</u> displays a single view containing a form for starting
a new RFI request. It has fields for entering the RFI's subject and message-text, and a button for choosing files
to attach as in the figure below.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a document with <u>one or more pre-existing RFIs</u> opens two further views. The first view lists
existing RFIs (and can be used to view and respond to these RFIs) as in the figure below,
while the second view contains a form for starting a new RFI request.
</p>

In both these cases, clicking on the button <i>Return to Document List</i> below the RFI related views,
as in the figure below, causes the document list to be displayed again.
