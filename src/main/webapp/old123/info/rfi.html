The RFI page displays all RFIs that are relevant to you (the logged-in user). The table of entries has
columns showing the latest timestamp, subject, associated document, message count, text of last message,
and sender's name. The figure below shows an example view.

Any RFI entry in the table can be selected (for further processing) by clicking <i>select</i> in the last
column. Selecting a RFI in this way displays 2 further views shown below.

<p>
The top box lists all of the RFI's messages in full detail. If any of the messages have attached files,
they are hyperlinked in the last column. The name of the associated document can be seen at the bottom
left of the box. The bottom right has two buttons: <button class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">
Back to RFI List</button> and <button class="btn btn-xs btn-success">Close</button>.
The close button is available only to the RFI's initiator, and is enabled only if the RFI has not
already been closed.
</p>

<p>
The second box is used for responding to the RFI with a text message and optional attachments.
This box is only available when the RFI has not been closed.
